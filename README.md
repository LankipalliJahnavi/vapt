# vunerability assesment and penetration testing
This project report helps you understand all the steps to identify, analyze, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a network or system. The main objective of this assessment is to perform vulnerability analysis and monitor logs by using a Splunk cloud remote server. 
A vulnerability assessment is an information security process used to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a computer system or network. The purpose of vulnerability assessment is to determine the system’s vulnerabilities. The assessment can be performed manually or automatically. If performed manually, the tester will follow an assessment procedure to identify the vulnerabilities. If the manual assessment is not sufficient or time-consuming, then an automated vulnerability assessment can be used.
 
The main requirements to complete this assessment are:
•	Academy Virtual Machine Workstation.
•	Kali Virtual Machine Workstation.
•	Splunk and Splunk cloud Remote server.
